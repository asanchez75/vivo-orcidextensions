<h4>What is ORCID?</h4>
<p>
	An ORCID author identifier allows you to save time when submitting manuscripts to
    journals, by allowing you to enter and maintain your contact information and publishing
	history in one place. Once you have done this, you can automatically fill-in your publishing
  profile whenever you submit a manuscript with any participating journal.
